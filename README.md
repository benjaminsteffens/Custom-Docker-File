#  Ansible AWS Provisioner and Deployment Pipeline

This project provides an automated, end-to-end solution for provisioning AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**, deploying a Dockerized application using **Ansible**, and orchestrating the entire process via a **GitHub Actions** workflow.

##  Features

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defines and manages AWS resources (like an EC2 instance) using **Terraform**.
* **Automated Deployment:** Uses **Ansible** to connect to the provisioned EC2 instance, authenticate with AWS ECR, and deploy a specified Docker image.
* **Container Lifecycle Management:** The Ansible playbook ensures the old container is stopped and removed before pulling and running the new container.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** A **GitHub Actions** workflow automates the execution of the provisioning and deployment tasks on a manual trigger.
* **Secure Access:** AWS and SSH credentials are securely managed using GitHub Secrets.

##  Tech Stack

| Component | Tool / Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | GitHub Actions | CI/CD pipeline automation and execution |
| **Configuration Mgmt.** | Ansible | Remote command execution and application deployment |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform | Provisioning AWS resources |
| **Cloud Provider** | AWS (EC2, ECR) | Target infrastructure and container registry |
| **Application** | Docker | Containerization of the application |
| **Language** | YAML | For GitHub Workflow and Ansible Playbook |
| **Language** | HCL | For Terraform Configuration |

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following configured:

1.  **AWS Account:** An active AWS account with necessary permissions (EC2, ECR, IAM).
2.  **GitHub Repository:** This repository must contain the provided workflow, playbook, and configuration files.
3.  **Docker Image:** A Docker image pushed to the specified AWS ECR repository URI: `640168422415.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ben/test:latest`.

##  Configuration & Secrets

The GitHub Actions workflow relies on several repository secrets for authentication. You must set these up in your GitHub repository's settings under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.

| Secret Name | Purpose | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS Access Key ID | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS Secret Access Key | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` |
| `ANISBLETESTSECRET` | SSH Private Key for the EC2 Instance | Private key contents (starting with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----...`) |

##  Getting Started

### 1. File Structure

Ensure your repository has the following file structure:

. ├── .github/workflows/ │ └── aws-provisioner.yml # Your GitHub Actions workflow ├── automate.yml # Your Ansible Playbook ├── hosts.ini # Your Ansible Inventory (or named differently) └── main.tf # Your Terraform Configuration


> **Note:** The GitHub Actions workflow assumes the Ansible playbook is named `automate.yml`.

### 2. Manual Execution via GitHub Actions

The workflow is configured to run manually using the `workflow_dispatch` trigger.

1.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2.  Select the **Ansible AWS Provisioner** workflow.
3.  Click **Run workflow** and confirm the branch.

### 3. Workflow Steps (Internal Logic)

The `provision-aws-resources` job executes the following sequence:

1.  **Checkout Code:** Retrieves the repository files.
2.  **Configure AWS Credentials:** Sets up the AWS CLI environment using the provided secrets for the `us-east-1` region.
3.  **Install Ansible:** Installs the `ansible` package on the GitHub Actions runner.
4.  **Execute AWS Playbook:** Runs the core deployment logic using `ansible-playbook automate.yml`.

##  Ansible Playbook (`automate.yml`) Overview

The Ansible playbook's primary role is to deploy the Docker image from ECR to the target EC2 instance.

* **Target:** `hosts: [linux_ec2]` (The host defined in your inventory file).
* **Variables:** Defines `ecr_repo_uri`, `container_name`, ports, and region.

### Deployment Tasks

| Task Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Get ECR Docker login password** | Uses `aws ecr get-login-password` on the **local runner** (`delegate_to: localhost`) to securely fetch a temporary authentication token. |
| **2. Set the ECR login host** | Extracts the registry URL from the full repository URI. |
| **3. Log in to ECR on the EC2 instance** | Uses the fetched password to log in to ECR on the **remote EC2 instance**. |
| **4. Ensure old container is stopped and removed** | Stops and deletes any existing container with the same name. |
| **5. Pull the image from ECR** | Downloads the latest image from the authenticated ECR repository. |
| **6. Run the new container** | Starts the new container, ensuring it runs on port **80** on the host, mapping to container port **8080**. |

##  Ansible Inventory (`hosts.ini`)

The inventory file maps the logical host name (`linux_ec2`) to the target EC2 instance and specifies the necessary connection details.

```ini
[linux_ec2]
54.162.162.133 \
    ansible_user=ec2-user \
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file={{ secrets.ANISBLETESTSECRET }}
IMPORTANT: You must replace 54.162.162.133 with the public IP address or DNS name of your provisioned EC2 instance.

 Terraform Configuration
The project includes a basic Terraform resource definition (likely in main.tf) to define the EC2 instance.

Terraform

resource "aws_instance" "bentest" {
  ami           = "" # AMI ID must be provided here
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "pipelinetest"
  }
}
Note: For a complete solution, you would need to integrate terraform apply into the GitHub Actions workflow before the Ansible playbook runs, and also pass the dynamically created EC2 IP address into the Ansible inventory. This current setup requires the IP to be manually updated in the inventory.
